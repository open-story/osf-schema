# osf-schema
Open Story Foundation (OSF) is a framework that enables game developers to manage their story content as code. This approach is git-friendly and inspired by tools like Terraform, Bicep, and YAML-based configurations.

## Documents

We are exploring different schema formats for representing game data. The first entity is the **document**, which represents any static data that can be displayed in the game, such as encyclopedia entries or item descriptions.

The goal is to provide flexible, version-controlled, and human-readable ways to define and manage narrative content for games.
